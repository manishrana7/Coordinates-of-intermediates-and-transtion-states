1. The two folders (FeC2_at_SiO2 and FeC3_at_SiO2) contains the optimized coordiantes of all the intermediates and transition states appear in the methane conversion pathways at FeC2@SiO2 and FeC3@SiO2. 

2. The coordinates are in CONTCAR format, readable by VASP and VESTA.

3. The format of coordinate file names is as follows:

	CONTCAR_(name_of_intermediate/transition state)
