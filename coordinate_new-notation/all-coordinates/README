Notes: 


1. The two folders (FeC2_at_SiO2 and FeC3_at_SiO2) contains the optimized coordiantes of all the intermediates and transition states along the methane conversion on FeC2@SiO2 and FeC3@SiO2. 

2. The format of coordinate file names is as follows:

	CONTCAR_{name_of_intermediate/transition state]
