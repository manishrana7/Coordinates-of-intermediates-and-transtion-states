Notes: 


1. The two folders (FeC2_at_SiO2 and  FeC3_at_SiO2) contains the optimized coordiantes of all the intermediates and transition states. 

2. The format of coordinate file names is as follows:

	CONTCAR_(name_of_intermediate/transition state)

3. Name of some cooerdinate files contain "-p" and "-pp" which are used to represent single prime (') and double prime ('') symbols.
